__Data Analysis using SQL__

MySQL code to show the total minutes, total student count and avearge minutes watched:

``` 
with sales_sum as
(
SELECT course_id, minutes_watched,student_id,
SUM(minutes_watched) as total_minutes,
COUNT(student_id) as total_stud_counts
FROM 365_student_learning
group by course_id, minutes_watched,student_id
order by course_id, minutes_watched,student_id)
select s.course_id,
```

MySQL code to show the total rating, total rating count and avearge rating:__

```
with ratings_sum as
(select course_id,student_id,course_rating,
sum(course_rating) as total_rating,
count(student_id) as tot_stud_count
from 365_course_ratings
group by course_id,student_id,course_rating
order by course_id,student_id,course_rating)
select r.course_id,
ROUND(sum(r.total_rating),2) as tot_rating,
count(r.tot_stud_count) as total_rat_count,
ROUND(sum(r.total_rating)/count(r.tot_stud_count),2) as ave_rating
from ratings_sum as r
group by r.course_id
```

### Data Analysis using Tableau

Tableau Case  Code to calculate the subscription type:

```
CASE [Subscription Type]
WHEN "All" then ([Purc Type] = [Purc Type])
WHEN "Monthly" then ([Purc Type] = "0")
WHEN "Quarterly" then ([Purc Type] = "1")
WHEN "Annual" then ([Purc Type] = "2") 
WHEN "Free" then ([Purc Type] = "NULL") END
```

Tableau Case Code to calculate the subscription type:

```
CASE [User Type]
when "All" then ([Paid/Free] = [Paid/Free])
when "Free" then ([Paid/Free] = 0)
when "Paid" then ([Paid/Free] = 1) END
```
